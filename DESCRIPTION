Description: This package contains functions that facilitate collecting baseball statistics data from baseball-reference.com. These functions not only retreive and scrap data from a wide range of tables, but also from a wide range of years.
    Additionally, the data scraped is formatted as data frames with numeric entries that allow for easy manipulation and statistical analyzation.
    Overall, the package aims to reduce the workload required to collect this data manually to simple, easy to use functions.
